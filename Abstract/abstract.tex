In this project we show that the application of supervised machine learning methods, for the purpose of classification, on metabarcoding eDNA data is feasible. In particular, we use several classifiers to predict the water colour of 

 In this project has shown that the application of supervised machine learning methods to eDNA metabarcoding derived data for the classification of species assemblages into water colour is feasible.Furthermore, the classifiers were tested on three splitting methods based on the location of samples, mirroring different prediction conditions.
