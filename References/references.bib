The first international scientific conference on Barcoding of Life was held at the Natural History Museum in London in February 2005, and here we review the scientific challenges discussed during this conference and in previous publications. Although still controversial, the scientific benefits of {DNA} barcoding include: (i) enabling species identification, including any life stage or fragment, (ii) facilitating species discoveries based on cluster analyses of gene sequences (e.g. cox1={CO}1, in animals), (iii) promoting development of handheld {DNA} sequencing technology that can be applied in the field for biodiversity inventories and (iv) providing insight into the diversity of life.},

We are convinced that the sole prospect for a sustainable identification capability lies in the construction of systems that employ {DNA} sequences as taxon ‘barcodes’. We establish that the mitochondrial gene cytochrome c oxidase I ({COI}) can serve as the core of a global bioidentification system for animals. First, we demonstrate that {COI} profiles, derived from the low–density sampling of higher taxonomic categories, ordinarily assign newly analysed taxa to the appropriate phylum or order. Second, we demonstrate that species–level assignments can be obtained by creating comprehensive {COI} profiles. A model {COI} profile, based upon the analysis of a single individual from each of 200 closely allied species of lepidopterans, was 100\% successful in correctly identifying subsequent specimens. When fully developed, a {COI} identification system will provide a reliable, cost–effective and accessible solution to the current problem of species identification. Its assembly will also generate important new insights into the diversification of life and the rules of molecular evolution.},

Over the past three years, massively parallel {DNA} sequencing platforms have become widely available, reducing the cost of {DNA} sequencing by over two orders of magnitude, and democratizing the field by putting the sequencing capacity of a major genome center in the hands of individual investigators. These new technologies are rapidly evolving, and near-term challenges include the development of robust protocols for generating sequencing libraries, building effective new approaches to data-analysis, and often a rethinking of experimental design. Next-generation {DNA} sequencing has the potential to dramatically accelerate biological and biomedical research, by enabling the comprehensive analysis of genomes, transcriptomes and interactomes to become inexpensive, routine and widespread, rather than requiring significant production-scale efforts.},
