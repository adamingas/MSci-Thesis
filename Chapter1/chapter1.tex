\section{Motivation}

Increased human populations during the industrialisation of the 19th century was accompanied by increasing amounts of unmanaged waste that produced public health problems. The first attempts at remedying the issues where applied mostly to running waters, and had a bacteriological focus \cite{AQUATIC_INSECTS_BIOMONITORING}. As time passed, managing freshwater systems became more important and evolved into a more complex procedure that took into account entire aquatic communities (like macro-invertebrates and fish) rather than specific species.



Nearing the end of the 20th century, "ecological health" became a priority in some human societies; people begun pressuring public authorities to restore freshwater systems to a healthier state. This is also reflected in the political sphere with the rise of Green parties in more economically developed nations across the world. Subsequently, huge budgets have been allocated in the management of freshwater, and other, systems; an example being the restoration of the Emscher river system which has an estimated cost of US\$5.5billion \cite{emscher}. 

 The driving motive today for the assessment of environmental consequences (from plans, policies or projects) around the world is coming from regional legislation, operations of Non-Governmental Organisations and requirements set by the financial backers of projects in the area. Legal procedures, policies and instruments are set up to ensure that decision makers take into consideration the environmental impacts of their projects; examples include the Environmental Impact Assessment Directive of the European Union \cite{eia_eu} and the Environmental Protection Agency in the United States \cite{us_epa_our_2013}, both of which became operational around the 1970s.
 
Environmental studies are conducted all around the world to establish how and in what ways human activities affect their environment, if and what the negative consequences are, and how this change propagates. 

Environmental studies conducted all around the world test sites such as fish farms (for example in New Zealand, Scotland, Norway and others), rivers that cross various landscapes, land (used for dairy-farming, horticulture, or where different kinds of forests grow)\cite{hermans_bacteria_2016} and many others. A good way to infer the health of an environment is by investigating the species inhabiting it, and in particular their relative abundance\footnote{Species abundance is the number of individuals comprising a species in a particular area. Relative abundance is how individuals in a community are distributed among species.}; some species are very intolerant of pollution (Alderfly Larva) whereas others are tolerant (Leeches, Blood Worms). Thus, the distribution of the individuals in the various species (or other higher taxonomic groups) can tell us a lot about the levels of pollution. In rivers, the quality of water can be assessed by examining macro invertebrates and vertebrate found at different sites. In land, soil bacterial community composition can be used to infer soil condition and health \cite{hermans_bacteria_2016}.




The health of the environment in a particular area is closely related to finding out their relative abundance might be necessary to evaluate the quality of their habitat. The traditional method of identifying species is morpho-taxonomic, which requires expert knowledge, is time consuming and thus expensive. 


Why is measuring the quality of environment important

Legal requirements by eu and other agencies



what was done (taxonomic identification) and what can be done
Older biomonitoring techniques relied too much on expert opinion and on a limited number of easily identifiable taxa. The methodologies used were not scientific. MEasuring the relative abundance of these taxa is not enough to assess the quality of an environment, especially if it is done in isolation. The whole community has to be taken into account and the way the species interact to get a full picture. \textbf{tocite}{woodward}
Dna sequencing technology has undergone impressive improvements over the last year, with the advent of next generation sequencing. High-throughput sequencing is orders of magnitude cheaper and faster than traditional sanger sequencing. This leap of in sequencing capacity can revolutionise a variety of scientific disciplines \textbf{cite shendure 2008}. One such application of NGS is the health evaluation of habitats. \textbf{cite taberlet 2012}

\section{Metabarcoding}
Bacteria can be used as bioindicators to determine health of environment. This can be done because bacterial communities respond to changes in soil more than differences in the climate or geography.  bacterial taxonomic groups respond differently to various soil atributes (pH, carbon-to-nitrogen rations, Olsen P\footnote{Measure of plant available phosphorous} etc). Thus, the relative abundance of specific taxa reflect the impact of specific anthropogenic activities on the environment, even when comparing soil samples across large geographical areas.\cite{hermans_bacteria_2016}

similar way to the same environmental stressors as benthic macrofauna
communities.(Stoeck 2018)
