\begin{acknowledgements}      


I would like to thank NatureMetrics and my supervisor Dr Ben Calderhead for giving me the opportunity to work on this problem and to learn so much about ecology and genomics.

I would also like to thank Dr Oliver Ratmann for taking up the role of supervisor on such a short notice and for giving me valuable advice for writing my thesis.

Finally I would like to thank my friend Kendeas Theofanous with whom I had lengthy conversations on the subject and whose insight on machine learning I found valuable.
